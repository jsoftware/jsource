All allocated and variable data for a J instance is accessed through
its JST structure.

Only simple constant data can be global and are shared by J instances.

Constants such as mtm are created in the dll process_attach. They are
the same for all instances and are never freed.  The dll is never
allowed to unload as we don't have code to free mtm et. al.

j.map must be checked to ensure no 'bad' global data exists. In
windows the global data that needs scrutiny is in the 0003: section.
