// Parsing follows the description in Dictionary Chapter E. Parsing
// with the following implementation details:
// 1. words must have gone through enqueue, which puts type information into the low 4 bits of each pointer with QCTYPE flags
// 2. the leading mark is not written before the sentence, but is implied
// 3. During each symbol lookup the value read is ra()d and the type flags are converted to QCGLOBAL semantics.
// 4. the stack contains a pointer to the word (converted to QCFAOWED semantics), the token number in the original sentence that will
//     be blamed in case of error, and a binary mask indicating which parsing lines the word is recognized in, in
//     each of the 4 stack popsitions.  The 'search of the parse table' is done by ANDing 4 bytes together.
// 5. all executions from parsing lines 0-2 are inplaceable
// 6. if the result of an execution in lines 0-2 is assigned to a name, jt->zombieval is set to point to the value if that value can be modified in place
// 7. after execution in lines 0-2, abandoned arguments that are still abandoned are freed immediately
// 8. After an execution, any stacked value that came from a symbol lookup is fa()d
// 9. forks are processed through line 5.  All other bidents/tridents are processed through line 6, which calls jthook to do the work
// 10. minimal error information is preserved.  When an error occurs, jtjsignal calls back to infererrtok to figure out where the error happened
// 11. end-of-parse is often detected early, especially after an assignment
// 12. In certain cases the parse knows it can stack 2 or even 3 words before checking for an executable fragment
//
// There is a separate path for one-word sentences.  If you add any feature, check to see if you have to add it to the one-word path also.

// but it can be inplaceable when passed into +/.
//
// By setting the inplaceable flag in a result, a verb warrants that the block does not contain and is not contained in
// any other block.
//
// The 2 LSBs of jt are set to indicate inplaceability of arguments.  The caller sets them when e
// has no further use for the argument AND e knows that the callee can handle in-place arguments.
// An argument is inplaceable only if it is marked as such in the block AND in jt.
// A caller should set the bit in jt only if it knows that the argument is inplaceable, which
// will be true if (1) the block was created by the caller; or (2) the block was an argument to the caller with jt
// marked to indicate its inplaceability
//
// Bit 0 of jt is for w, bit 1 for a.
//
// There is one more piece to the inplace system: reassigned names.  When there is an
// assignment to a name, the block being reassigned can be reused for the output if:
//   the usecount is 2 (1 for the name, 1 for the ra() in the lookup)
//   the current execution is the only thing on the stack
//   the name can be resolved before the execution
//
// The first rule is to have no truck with inplacing unless the execution is known to be locative-safe,
// i. e. will not change locale, path, or any name that might go into a locative.  This is marked by a
// flag ASGSAFE in the verb.
//
// If jt->zombieval is set, the (necessarily inplaceable) verb may choose to perform an in-place
// operation.  It will check usecounts and addresses to decide whether to do this
