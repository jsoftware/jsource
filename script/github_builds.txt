github builds

Whenever the jsource repo is updated, the JE binaries are built and standard tests are run.

The process is defined in the repo workflow:

  .github/workflows/jsource.yml

This workflow calls files in the repo script:

  buildga.cmd   - windows builds
  testga.cmd    - windows tests

  buildga.sh    - non-windows builds
  testga.sh     - non-windows tests

  testgares.sh  - combines test results from each build

The tests start J and load testga.ijs to run the test suite.

Builds take place on runners which are machines created dynamically for each OS. Elapsed time is around 1-2 hours for a successful run.

If there is any failure, the entire workflow is halted.

To see the status of a run, login to github and visit:

  https://github.com/jsoftware/jsource/actions

Recent runs are shown with a status mark. Drill down into a run name for the compile logs.

If a run completes successfully, the JE binaries and test results are written to github area:

  https://github.com/jsoftware/jsource/releases/tag/build

If the version is updated in the repo version.txt file, then after the first successful build the JE binaries are copied to the corresponding download area on the J webserver, e.g.

  https://www.jsoftware.com/download/jengine/j9.6

Github actions are documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions
